# override_*
###############
#The override_* params specify if a given function of the firmware should be overriden by HBL
# values can be 0, 1, or -1 (see specific parameters for details)
#
# 0  : attempt to estimate syscall (let the HBL do its job)
#
# 1  : use the override if/when available 
#    (usually overrides are guaranteed to work, unlike syscall estimates, but they might have drawbacks.
#    for example, the override for sceCtrlPeekBufferPositive is sceCtrlReadBufferPositive, which will work all the time but is slower
#
# -1 : replace the function with a function that does nothing and returns 0 (ok).
#    Usually not recommended, only to avoid some crashes for functions that are "not really required".
#    a good example is sceIoMkdir which is sometimes only needed the first time a game is ran, when the game creates
#    its default directories. Instead of estimating sceIoMkdir, you can create the folders manually, and tell the homebrew to do nothing
#   Whenever sceIoMkdir is called
#
# Overrides are only useful on firmware 6.20 for PSP2000/3000/1000. On lower firmwares, and all models on the psp go,
# Since syscall estimation is perfect, those tricks are not needed
# 0 is the defaut value

# override_sceIoMkdir

# override_sceIoMkdir=-1

# override_sceCtrlPeekBufferPositive
# values: 0, 1
# 0: attempt to estimate syscall (emulators will be faster, but there's a risk that the game doesn't start)
# 1: Use the override (sceCtrlReadBufferPositive). Slower but guaranteed to work
